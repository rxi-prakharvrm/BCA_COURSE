## EDI

- EDI stands for Electronic Data Interchange.
- It's a document standard.

- It is more than a mere E-mail, i.e, organizations might replace bills of lading and even cheques with appropriate EDI messages.
- In 1996, the National Institute of Standards and Technology defined electronic data interchange or EDI as "the computer-to-computer interchange of strictly formatted messages that represent documents other than monetary instruments.
- EDI implies a sequesnce of messages between two parties, either of whom may serve as originator or recipient.

## E-commerce Architecture

1. Two-tier Architecture
2. Three-tier Architecture

### 1. Two-tier Architecture

- In Two-tier architecturre the user interface runs on the client and the database is stored on the server.
- The user application logic can either run on the client or the server.
- It allows the client processes to run separately from the server processes on different computers.

### 2. Three-tier Architecture

- The Three-tier architecture is emerged in the 1990s to overcome the limitations of Two-tier architecture.
- In Three-tier architecture, the user interface and the business application logic, also known as business rules and data storage and access, are developed and maintained as independent modules.
- The Three-tier architecture includes three-tiers: top-tier, middle-tier and third-tier
- The top-tier includes the user interface.
- The middle-tier provides process management services such as process development, process monitoring and process resourcing that are shared by the multiple applications.
- The third-tier provides database management functionality.
