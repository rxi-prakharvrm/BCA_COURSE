## <span style="color:gold;"> Access Control </span>

---

- Access Control is a privacy feature that enables authorised users to access the system, in contrast it disallows the unauthorised persons.

- _For example, when a user wants to access the **ATM** Machine, he enters the pin and then the system check for the user authentication if the user is authenticated, machine allows him to withdraw the money else it doesn't allow the user to do so._

## <span style="color:gold;"> Data Confidentiality </span>

---

- Data Confidentiality is roughly equivalent to _data privacy_.

- Data Confidentiality is a measure undertaken to ensure that the data doesn't go into the wrong hands.

## <span style="color:gold;"> Substitution Cipher </span>

---

In substitution cipher, each letter of the plain text is replaced by another letter, number or symbol i.e.

- Cipher is a substitution cipher in which each letter in the alphabet is replaced or substituted by another alphabet that is three position forward.

  a -> d, b -> e and so on.

  **Formula:**

  - C = E(P) = (P+3) mod 26
  - P = D(C) = (C-3) mod 26

- This cipher is also called as **shift transformation**.
- This is very easy to break.

## <span style="color:gold;"> Transposition Cipher </span>

---

- Transposition cipher is different from substitution cipher as it encrypt and decrypt data by performing some sort of permutations.

- In transposition cipher, the letters of the plain text are just transposed to create different permutation of cipher text.

- For Example:

| Plain Text                           | Cipher Text                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
|                                      | `T I I T E N Y A T C M O T O` |
|                                      | `H S S H O L W Y O O E U N W` |

## <span style="color:gold;"> Block Cipher & Stream Cipher </span>

---

| <span style="color:gold;"> Block Cipher </span>                                                  | <span style="color:gold;"> Stream Cipher </span>                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Block Cipher converts the plain text into cipher text by taking plain text's block at a time. | 1. Stream Cipher converts the plain text into cipher text by taking 1 byte of plain text at a time. |
| 2. Block Cipher uses either 64 bits or more than 64 bits.                                        | 2. While stream cipher uses 8 bits.                                                                 |
| 3. The complexity of block cipher is simple.                                                     | 3. While stream cipher is more complex.                                                             |
| 4. Block Cipher uses confusion as well as diffusion.                                             | 4. Stream cipher only uses confusion.                                                               |
| 5. In block cipher, reverse encrypted text is hard.                                              | 5. While in stream cipher, reverse encrypted text is easy.                                          |
| 6. Slow as compared to stream cipher.                                                            | 6. While stream cipher is fast in comparison to block cipher.                                       |

<!-- ## <span style="color:gold;"> Playfair Cipher </span>

---

1. The Playfair Cipher is manual symmetric encryption cipher.

2. The playfair Cipher encrypts pairs of letters(diagraphs), instead of single letters as the case with simpler substitution ciphers such as the ceaser cipher

3. Frequency Analysis is still possible on the Playfair cipher however it would be against 600 possible paris of letters instead of 26 different possible letters.

4. Playfair cipher is much more secure that the older substitution ciphers.

> ### Steps to create a Playfair Cipher

- Let's say we want to use the phrase **"Hello World"** as our key.
- The first characters (going left to right) in the table will be the phrase with duplicate letters removed.
- The rest of the table will filled with the remaining letters of the alphabet, in order.
- Our key table world look like this:
- |     |     |     |     |     |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | H   | E   | L   | O   | W   |
  | R   | D   | A   | B   | C   |
  | F   | G   | I/J | K   | M   |
  | N   | P   | Q   | S   | T   |
  | U   | V   | X   | Y   | Z   | -->

## <span style="color:gold;">RSA (Rivest Shamir Adleman)</span>

---

It is a popular encryption standard or encryption algorithm. It is widely used for data sent online and relies on a public key to encrypt the data. Those on the receiving end of the data will have their own private key to decode the messages. It's proven to be a secure way to send information between people who may not know each other and want to communicate without compromising their personal or sensitive data.

1. Choose two different large random prime numbers p and q.
2. Calculate **<span style="color:violet">n = pq</span>**
3. Calculate **<span style="color:violet">Ï•(n) = (p-1)\*(q-1)</span>**
4. Choose e (_public key_) such that **<span style="color:violet">1<e<Ï•(n)</span>**
5. e is co-prime to Ï•(n), **<span style="color:violet">gcd(e, Ï•(n)) = 1</span>**
6. Calculate d (_private key_) such that **<span style="color:violet">de â‰¡ 1 mod Ï•(n)</span>**
7. Public key 'e' and Private key 'd'

## <span style="color:gold;">Internetwork Security</span>

---

- The security of an internetwork or a local network is called **Internetwork Security**.

- Internetwork security is implemented to control the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your information by any means.

![Internetwork_Security_Image](https://img.brainkart.com/imagebk9/pfebZo6.jpg)

## <span style="color:gold;">Three Security Goals</span>

---

1. Confidentiality
2. Integrity
3. Availability

### 1. Confidentiality

The first goal of Network Security is **Confidentiality**. The function of confidentiality is to protect precious business data from unauthorized persons.

### 2. Integrity

The second goal of Network Security is **Integrity**. Integrity aims at maintaining and assuring the accuracy and consistency of data.

### 3. Availability

The third goal of network security is **Availability**. The function of Availability in Network Security is to make sure that the Data, Network Resources or Network Services are continuously available to the legitimate users, whenever they require it.

## <span style="color:gold;">Avalanche Effect</span>

---

Avalanche effect is when a slight change in input reflects a significant change in the output.

## <span style="color:gold;">Random Numbers</span>

---

For a number to be a random number, two conditions must be met:

- The values are uniformly distributed over a defined interval or set, and
- It is impossible to predict future values based on past or present ones.

## <span style="color:gold;">Difference between Confusion and Diffusion</span>

---

| Confusion                                                                             | Diffusion                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Confusion is a cryptographic technique which is used to create faint cipher texts. | 1. While diffusion is used to create cryptic plain texts.    |
| 2. This technique is posiible through substitution algorithm.                         | 2. While it is possible through transportation algorithm.    |
| 3. In Confusion, vagueness is increased in resultant.                                 | 3. While in diffusion, redundancy is increased in resultant. |
| 4. Both stream cipher and block cipher uses confusion.                                | 4. Only block cipher uses diffusion.                         |

## <span style="color:gold;">Kerberos</span>

---

- Kerberos is the name of a computer network authentication protocol, which allows individuals communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner.

- Its designers aimed primarily at a client-server model, and it provides mutual authentication both the user and the server varify each other's identity.

- Kerberos protocol messages are protected against eavesdropping and replay attacks.

- Kerberos builds on symmetric key cryptography and requires a trusted third party.

### How Kerberos works?

1. User login and request services on the host. Thus user requests for ticket-granting service.

2. Authentication Server verifies user's access right using database and then gives ticket-granting-ticket and session key. Results are encrypted using the password of the user.

3. The decryption of the message is done using the password then send the ticket to Ticket Granting Server. The Ticket contains authenticators like usernames and network addresses.

4. Ticket Granting Server decrypts the ticket sent by User and authenticator verifies the request then creates the ticket for requesting services from the server.

5. The user sends the Ticket and Authenticator to the Server.

6. The server verifies the Ticket and authenticators then generate access to the service. After this User can access the services.

### Limitations of Kerberos

1. It doesn't work well in a timeshare environment.

2. Requires an always-on Kerberos server.

3. Stores all passwords and encrypted with a single key.

4. Assumes workstations are secure.

## <span style="color:gold;">Pretty Good Privacy</span>

---

- PGF stands for Pretty Good Privacy which is invented by Phil Zimmermann.
- PGP was designed to provide all four aspects of security, i.e, privacy, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation in the sending of email.
- PGP uses a digital signature to privide integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation.
- PGP uses a combination of secret key encryption and public key encryption to privide privacy.
- PGP is an open source and freely available software package for email security.
- PGP privides authentication through the use of Digital Signature.
- It provides confidentiality through the use of symmetric block encryption.
- It provides compression by using the ZIP algorithm, and EMAIL compatibility using the radix-64 encoding scheme.
- The e-mail message is hashed by using hashing function to create a digest.
- The digest is then encrypted to form a signed digest by using the sender's private key, and then signed digest is added to original email message.
- The original message and signed digest are encrypted by using a one-time secret key created by the sender.
- The secret key is encrypted by using a receiver's public key.
- Both the encrypted secret key and the encrypted combination of message and digest are sent together.

## <span style="color:gold;">Transport Layer Security</span>

---

- Transport Layer Security is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network.
- The protocol is widely used in applications such as email, instant messaging, and voice over IP, but its use in securing HTTPS remains the most publicly visible.
- It is a standard based on SSL 3.0.
- Not interoperable with SSL.
