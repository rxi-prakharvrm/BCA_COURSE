# System Analysis and Design

## What is a System?

---

A system is a collection of elements or components that work together to accomplish a commom task.

## What is system analysis and design?

---

System analysis and design is the study in which we learn how to analyse an existing system or create a better one.

## What is system analysis?

---

- System analysis is the process of studying and observing a system to know how it works and to identify its goal and purposes.

- System analysis is conducted for the purpose of studying a system or its parts in order to identify its objectives.

- It specifies **"What the system would do ?"**

## What is system design?

---

- It is the process of planning a new system or replacing an existing system.

- It is done by defining its components or modules to satisfy the specific requirement.

## Properties of a system

1. Organisation
2. Integration
3. Interation
4. Interdependance
5. Central Objective

### 1. Organisation

Elements of the system should be well organised in an structured manner.

### 2. Integration

All the components of the system should be integrated to work accurately.

### 3. Interation

In system, interaction of the elements or the components is very important to be integrated and work in the way to achieve the objective.

### 4. Interdependance

Interdependancy should also be in the system, if all the elements of the system are working independently or they are fully dependent on each other. These both situations are not good. In the system, elements should be interdependent.

### 5. Central Objective

There should be a central objective in the system to be achieved.
